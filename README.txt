Hi, i'm Christian Ko≈æuh and i am currently developing and publishing my Software.
This is my official download Website for this Software.
If you want to try it, you can download it!

NOTE: The program is most campatible with Windows 10 and Windows 11. I made it on Windows 11.
      Older Versions of Windows like Windows 8.1 or 7 and older are probably compatible, but i hanen't tested these Windows Versions.
      I will try and make a Update to get these Windows Versions maybe even Windows XP compatible with it!
      The Antivirus or Windows Defender might think that the Software is a Malware. This is because i didn't made a signature that it is not a Virus.
      For more informaton check the Changelog of the Software in the Website!

Enjoy using it!
